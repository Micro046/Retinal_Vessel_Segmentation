## 📄 Abstract

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness, and early detection is vital to prevent vision loss. This project proposes an improved deep learning framework for segmenting thick and thin retinal blood vessels using **UNET**. The architecture segments thin and thick vessels separately and fuses the outputs for a more accurate binary segmentation map.

## 🧠 Methodology

* **Dual Training**: Thick and thin vessels are segmented separately using separate training objectives.
* **Exemplar-Based Inpainting**: To restore non-vessel regions for better differentiation.
* **Fusion Strategy**: Combines multiple probability maps for final segmentation.
* **UNET Architecture**: Encoder-decoder design with skip connections for detailed semantic segmentation.
* **Loss Optimization**: Weighted loss maps to prioritize challenging pixel regions (thin vessels).

## 🗂 Dataset

* **Dataset Used**: [DRIVE](https://drive.grand-challenge.org/)
* **Images**: 40 retinal fundus images (565×584 resolution)
* **Split**: 20 training and 20 testing images
* **Preprocessing**: Data augmentation using Horizontal/Vertical flips, Elastic/Optical transformations, and Dropout.

## ✅ Conclusion

We present a segmentation framework that significantly enhances the detection of **thin vessels** by training them independently and fusing multiple maps. The proposed method is robust, performs well under low-contrast conditions, and is suitable for **automated diabetic retinopathy screening** in real-world applications.
